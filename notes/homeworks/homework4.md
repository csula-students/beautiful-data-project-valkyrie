In this homework, your job is to **polish** and **publish** your visualization from homework 3.

To recall, in homework 3, you did EDA and present your own findings to us in a private video.

Now, you will have to publish your homework to public in some way.

In summary, we want you to show visualization on internet!

But how?

There are various suggestions we have for you:

  1. Host ElasticSearch on [AWS][2]
  2. Host your visualization like D3 on cloud hosting solution like [Firebase][1]
* Publish blog post:
  1. Create and store your visualizations in Python
  2. Write your blog post in HTML format with visualizations above
  3. Host your HTML on cloud hosting solution like [Firebase][1]

### Statements to answer for visualizations
